We're building our product entirely with Python on the server side. We're using Pyramid for our web framework; we like Pyramid because it has a more functional style than Flask, and it's more flexible than Django. We use PostgreSQL with SQLAlchemy for persistent data. We love open source projects, and we try to open-source the Python tools that we build whenever possible.</p>\r\n<p>We're meticulous about <strong>test-driven development</strong>. TDD just feels right; by writing tests, you refine the purpose of your code before your write it. TDD also makes refactoring a joy, and writing code should be joyful! Some argue that TDD is slow. In our experience, the more you do TDD, the faster it gets.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Compensation</strong></p>\r\n<p>We're offering up to <strong>$140k</strong> annual salary, depending on experience. Benefits include fully paid health insurance (including dental &amp; vision), a 401k plan, and generous vacation time.

Co-working spaces can get noisy; we have our own office with a door that closes, so we can program in peace and quiet.</p>            </div>\r\n            <h3>Joel Test score: 10 out of 12</h3>\r\n            <p>\r\n                The <a href=\"http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000043.html\">Joel Test</a> is a twelve-question measure of the quality of a software team.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <ul id=\"joeltest\">\n<li class=\"checked\">Do you use source control?</li>\r\n                    <li class=\"checked\">Can you make a build in one step?</li>\r\n                    <li class=\"checked\">Do you make daily builds?</li>\r\n                    <li>Do you have a bug database?</li>\r\n                    <li class=\"checked\">Do you fix bugs before writing new code?</li>\r\n                    <li class=\"checked\">Do you have an up-to-date schedule?</li>\r\n                    <li class=\"checked\">Do you have a spec?</li>\r\n                    <li class=\"checked\">Do programmers have quiet working conditions?</li>\r\n                    <li class=\"checked\">Do you use the best tools money can buy?</li>\r\n                    <li>Do you have testers?</li>\r\n                    <li class=\"checked\">Do new candidates write code during their interview?</li>\r\n                    <li class=\"checked\">Do you do hallway usability testing?</li>\r\n            </ul>\n<div class=\"apply clear\">\r\n\r\n                            <div id=\"careers-wrapper\">\r\n                                <i data-jobid=\"40433\"></i>\r\n                                    <script type=\"text/javascript\">\r\n                                        (function () {\r\n                                            var po = document.createElement('script'); po.type = 'text/javascript'; po.async = true;\r\n                                            po.src = 'http://careers.stackoverflow.com/mvcjs/apply.js';\r\n                                            var s = document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0]; s.parentNode.insertBefore(po, s);\r\n                                        })();\r\n                                    </script>\n</div>\r\n<script id=\"embed-body\" type=\"text/template\">\r\n<i data-jobid=\"40433\"></i>\r\n\\u003cscript type=\"text/javascript\">\r\n(function () {\r\n    var po = document.createElement('script'); po.type = 'text/javascript'; po.async = true;\r\n    po.src = 'http://careers.stackoverflow.com/mvcjs/apply.js';\r\n    var s = document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0]; s.parentNode.insertBefore(po, s);\r\n})();\r\n\\u003c/script>\r\n</script>\n</div>\r\n        <img data-analyticurl=\"/analytics/jobapply/40433\" alt=\"apply\" id=\"applyanalytic\" class=\"analytic\"><span class=\"analytic\" outurl=\"/analytics/jobout/40433\"></span>", :digest => "a55caac5bd090add7a", :url => "http://careers.stackoverflow.com/jobs/40433/python-developer-small-team-tdd-lacoda" },

Frequently, I am asked to provide insight on the best approach in the development of a solution. As an employee, this conveys that my expertise is highly valued and respected. This encourages me to continually strive for efficiency and creativity in my solutions.</li>\r\n<li>\n<strong>Utilization of New Technologies: </strong>In my 19 years as developer, the one thing that has remained constant is the need to keep abreast of new technologies and methods. In the past six months, tools like Kendo UI and Sitefinity CMS have been introduced along with training in topics such as MVC and Jquery. Every Thursday, the development team comes together to either train or share new development practices. Learning is an important part of our development path.</li>\r\n<li>\n<strong>Success is Shared: </strong>Bayshore Solutions provides opportunities in monthly <a href=\"http://www.bayshoresolutions.com/about-bayshore-solutions/careers.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">Town Hall</a> meetings to discuss all aspects of the company’s inner workings. Discussions can range from the projected financial goals and tracking of actual results to the items that the employees would like to see included in the vending machines. It seems my idea of adding Pork Rinds didn’t make the cut. There’s always next month…</li>\r\n<li>\n<strong>Fun: </strong>I chose my profession because it challenges me and gives me a sense of accomplishment when I implement a creative solution.

Now, Seattle is the home of our Platform Team, who launched a spectacular strategic technology this spring to roaring success.</p>\n\n<p>And we're just getting started. How would you like to take the team, the project, and the lab to the next level?</p>\n\n<p>You really do need to be an ace manager for this with proven technical chops. Our engineers are particularly smart, creative, hard-working, and capable collaborators. They need leadership, not supervision. Managers here are mentors who lead by example and coach their teams. They continually improve the work environment to bring out the best in everyone. Our managers work hard to stay invisible. If you're a command-and-control person, this is not the right place for you. If you've been a software engineer yourself, and you love helping other engineers excel, we might be the perfect place.</p>\n\n<p>Management here is serious business. We have the best management mentoring program in any start-up -- perhaps the best, period. New Relic has a strong team culture, so expect to receive, and contribute to, a collaborative, supportive environment. Working at New Relic, you'll have a rare opportunity to challenge yourself and propel your ability to lead to the next level, with the support and guidance of a talented and dedicated team.</p>\n\n<p>Plus, the project is awesome. Platform blends all the cool things you can imagine: a consumer experience for acquiring plugins, an IDE for building them, outreach to a growing community of developers, open source, API, and deep technical integration into the rest of the New Relic experience. </p>\n\n<p>You'll be a serious candidate if you have several years of experience as a sharp engineer, a track record of delivering socially complex projects, and a couple of years or more serving in a management or lead role. You must get the agile /SaaS lifecycle, incremental delivery, and continuous deployment. You're someone who acts with drive and urgency, yet always takes the time to listen and to do the right thing. You are constantly seeking new ways to explain, coach, teach, and bring out the best in others. </p>\n\n<p>Tell us about your management philosophy in your cover letter and give examples of your role in delivering software projects with a team. And, of course, we want to hear why you might be particularly interested in New Relic.</p>\n\n<p>A little about us</p>\n\n<p>We are passionate, possibly even crazy, about application performance management (APM). Our mission is to make web applications run better, to make the internet more productive, and to make life easier for developers and devops. We are turning the APM marketplace upside down by providing SaaS products that deliver high-value functionality previously only available through enterprise software. We are well above 50,000 customers. And with your help we’ll get to 10x that number.</p>\n\n<p>New Relic is a San Francisco Best Places to Work 2012 award winner, a Top 100 OnDemand Company, Best of SaaS (THINKStrategies), Top 100 Coolest Cloud Computing (CRN); 10 Cloud Management Companies to Watch (NetworkWorld); the list of accolades goes on. More important, we provide challenging work, opportunities to learn, high quality teammates, a standard-setting product, and a company on the move.</p>\n\n<p>The position is in our downtown Seattle, Washington office. We can help with relocation. We offer competitive compensation, pre-IPO stock options, and big-company benefits (medical, dental, vision, life), while maintaining the energy, agility, and fun of a start-up.</p>\n\n<p>New Relic is most decidedly an equal opportunity employer. We eagerly seek applicants of diverse background and hire without regard to race, color, gender, religion, national origin, ancestry, citizenship, disability, age, sexual orientation, or any other characteristic protected by law. Note: Our stewardship of the data of many thousands of customers means that a criminal background check is required to join New Relic.</p>", :digest => "c14b06ac215e45264d", :url => "http://jobs.github.com/positions/7c248f44-20ae-11e3-9b8c-50ee8b24365c" },

Not only that but you can help form the technology team in any UK major city.</strong></p>\n\n<p>After a successful launch and investment round, we are looking to hire up to three experienced developers to become the founding members of a technology team that will evolve the business from an offline careers network and events company into a true technology recruiting platform. We believe that our existing network of Bright graduates puts us in a unique position to build a platform that connects the best employers with the brightest graduates. But that's just the start: we have big ambitions to take our platform outside of the graduate market, into every sector and industry where employers value the network of people they hire from.</p>\n\n<p>The really exciting part is that you get to build our technology platform right from the inception, including taking part in the choice of languages, frameworks and tech processes. (To date the Bright Network has created a simple content site enabling candidates to register, create a profile and for employers to list their opportunities and company profiles. It has been built in a custom PHP framework with a postgres database.)</p>\n\n<p>Reporting into the head of product and technology you’ll also be heavily involved in defining the minimal viable product and helping it to evolve as we launch successive iterations and learn more about our customers. We believe in lean startup principles where the customer, their use of the product, and a fast iterating tech team are critical to our success.</p>\n\n<p>We recognise that some of the brightest tech talent isn’t necessarily in London and so we are considering near-sourcing the technology team to a UK city within easy reach of our offices in London. We still want to maintain a close-knit team so regular travel to London for sprint-planning meetings is a must.  And of course all technology team members must work in the same satellite office.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Who you’ll be working with</strong></p>\n\n<p>Tom Brightwell is the Head of Product &amp; Technology at Bright Network. He has 10 years of experience in leading product and tech teams across a range of industries and technologies.

Call us crazy, but we live travel, breathe travel, heck we even dream about it sometimes.  It’s our mission to inspire, inform and connect travellers so we’re building the biggest and best travel site on the planet. Do you want to help drive the direction of Lonelyplanet.com as part of a talented, passionate team? Are you raring to work somewhere fast-paced and fun? We want to hear from you.</p>\n\n<p>About the role:<br>\nThe Lonely Planet Online team is responsible for delivering lonelyplanet.com, a place that inspires, connects and helps travellers. We are challenged with bringing over 40 years of authored travel content to life on the web in a way that is engaging for our community and relevant for individual travellers.</p>\n\n<p>We’re passionate about our products and the evolving technologies we use to build them. We want engineers that want to build stuff quickly, probably break things along the way and fix it even faster. We use lean principles. We value rapid deployment, metrics driven engineering and experimentation.</p>\n\n<p>We love open source development and encourage developers to open source their work or contribute to open source projects. Do you contribute to an open source project or write a blog? Let us know. We’re interested in what you’re excited about. Here’s what we’ve been up to:<br>\n - our engineering blog: <a href=\"http://engineering.lonelyplanet.com\">http://engineering.lonelyplanet.com</a> <br>\n - our GitHub repo: <a href=\"https://github.com/lonelyplanet\">https://github.com/lonelyplanet</a>.  </p>\n\n<p>You:<br>\n - love and have mastered Ruby (and hopefully some other languages too)<br>\n - bore friends by talking about test-driven development and automated testing frameworks (we use RSpec, Cucumber and Selenium)<br>\n - always use CI and continuous deployment (we use Jenkins)<br>\n - are unable to live without source code management (we use GitHub)<br>\n - need to understand technology problems as part of a broader product vision<br>\n - respect Ron Swanson (OK, this one isn’t really a requirement)<br>\n - have passion for travel and interest in building systems that connect travellers with content and each other.</p>\n\n<p>Our Technology:<br>\nWe’re big believers in ‘right tool for the right job’ and encourage engineers to try new technology. But just to give you a taste, this is some of the technology we’re currently big fans of:<br>\n - Ruby and Ruby on Rails<br>\n - Sass, Haml, Coffescript<br>\n - iOS and Android<br>\n - AWS, Chef<br>\n - Ubuntu, PostGres.</p>\n\n<p>We challenge Engineers to be involved in the product, not just the code. In weekly planning sessions, Engineers bring product and technology ideas and work together with a Product Manager to set priorities and goals for the week.</p>\n\n<p>At Lonely Planet we:<br>\n - support a healthy work-life balance<br>\n - provide flexible working arrangements<br>\n - work as a unified team across Design, Development, Product, Operations and other broader groups of very talented people<br>\n - are pretty relaxed about most things (everyone now and then someone even swears, you have been duly warned)<br>\n - don’t really care what you wear (so long as you are clothed)<br>\n - are obsessed with table tennis (not all of us).</p>\n\n<p>Lonely Planet currently has development teams in London and Melbourne and we’re growing a team in Nashville. Looking for people with a variety of skills and experience.</p>\n\n<p>Across LP we’re working with large amounts of content from our amazing authors and a growing number of other sources so we can continue to deliver rich, up to date content to travellers across a variety of products and platforms.</p>\n\n<p>Lonely Planet has always been at the forefront of travel in the digital world launching lonelyplanet.com in 1995 and travel guides for Palm Pilot in 1999 and iOS apps a decade later. That passion continues today with teams in London and Nashville continually innovating and improving the experience for travellers visiting our website.

In the past 30 years, computers have revolutionized the way people work, <strong>but only if they work behind a desk</strong>. The men and women who keep our buildings heated, cooled, watered, and powered work hard, but the software that's been \"designed\" for them is..., well, in most cases it's easier to use paper. We think they deserve better.</p>\n\n<p>Our product, <a href=\"http://www.logcheckapp.com/\">LogCheck</a>, is a mobile app designed to replace the paper logbooks widely used in basements and boiler rooms worldwide. Over a hundred buildings have switched to LogCheck, including <a href=\"http://youtu.be/Cfd7rWyZ65o?t=17m18s\" title=\"Modern Marvels, S13E02: Environmental Tech I\">The Solaire and Hearst Tower</a>, San Francisco State University, and both Staten Island Ferry terminals. <strong>We are solving a real problem</strong> and new customers are signing up every week.</p>\n\n<h2>Where you come in</h2>\n\n<p>LogCheck consists of a mobile iOS app (for performing inspections) backed by a Rails app (for review and analysis of data). We've proven that this is a product that building managers will pay for; now is the time to build out the features (and possibly new apps) they are asking for.</p>\n\n<p>You will take over development of our Rails app, giving <a href=\"https://github.com/benzado\">the current developer</a> more time to focus on iOS. You will work closely together, however, as you continue to build a team.</p>\n\n<p>You should have at least two years experience working with Rails 3 and be familiar with git, SQL, and why it's important to salt a hash. If you are interested in data analysis and statistics, that's great.

Send us your LinkedIn profile, Github repo, or anything else you feel would help us get to know you.", :content => "<p id=\"description\">\n    </p>\n<p>Hi. We're looking for an awesome Senior Rails Developer to join our growing team. If you've ever wanted to work for a interesting security startup with great people this is your chance. We're a little different than your average startup so we put together this FAQ.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Q: Ok who are you guys?</strong><br><strong>A:</strong> ThreatSim is comprised of some really smart security hackers who were tired of working for large companies. There are people here from MITRE, HP, Fortify, RSA, Verizon Business, Cybertrust, and others. We wanted to do the small company thing and it's worked well for us.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Q: What would I be working on?</strong><br><strong>A:</strong> You'd be working on our SaaS service, ThreatSim. It lets our customers send simulated phishing campaigns against themselves. When the user clicks on the simulated phishing link they are immediately shown training. It's an unconventional approach to changing user behavior and it works (hint: we have data).</p>\n\n<p>Essentially we get to think like bad guys and help our customers improve their security. It's an interesting space to say the least. If you ever wanted to learn more about security and cutting-edge attacks, this is the place. We simulate evil AND give our customers data that they can use to protect their organization. You will spend a lot of time thinking \"if I was a bad guy I'd...\" then have to pivot and think \"if I was a security engineer I'd...\".</p>\n\n<p><strong>Q: Where is this position located?</strong><br><strong>A:</strong> This is a remote position that is open to US residents only located within the US. We understand that not every rails developer wants to move to SF, NYC, or DC so we let you work wherever you are productive.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Q: What will my day to day be like as a developer?</strong><br><strong>A:</strong> You grab your coffee and commute to your home office (or coffee shop, whatever) in about 30 seconds. There, in the comfort of home, you work on new features, enhancements, and issues to ensure that ThratSim continues to be awesome. You keep in touch with the team using HipChat, Skype, Join.me, Google Hangout, and even an ol' IP phone. Using your company provided Macbook you write code, commit to Github, and listen to your friends complain about traffic on Facebook. From time to time you may respond to a customer support ticket. When you are done for the day you commute home in about 30 seconds.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Q: Who will I be working with?</strong><br><strong>A:</strong> Other developers, devops, the CTO, sales, and maybe even customers. We're a 15 person company so needless to say you'll know everyone on a first name basis.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Q: What hours do you work?</strong><br><strong>A:</strong> We generally work \"normal\" office hours but are flexible. Most of us are on the east coast (DC area) but as long as you are in the lower 48 we're good. We're a startup, so sometimes there are long hours. But we all have families so we aim for a good work-life balance.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Q: What technology to you use?</strong><br><strong>A:</strong> ThreatSim is built entirely within Amazon Web Services. Linux, load balancers, auto-scaling, sidekiq, redis, ansible, git, Splunk, HIDS, two-factor auth, disk encryption, and a lot of cool security stuff that you probably aren't used to seeing in a startup.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Q: What skills and qualities are you looking for in a candidate?</strong><br><strong>A:</strong> Here's a bullet list:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Ruby on Rails 3.0+</li>\n<li>Relational and non-relational databases: MySQL, Redis</li>\n<li>Background job processors (e.g. Sidekiq)</li>\n<li>Javascript frameworks (e.g. jQuery, pure JS)</li>\n<li>Client-side and server side MVC</li>\n<li>Comfortable with git for version control</li>\n<li>Continuous integration</li>\n<li>MS Office (hah right, could you imagine?)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The ideal candidate will be comfortable working remote and managing themselves. You will be an integral part of the team with a huge impact on the future of our product. We're passionate about what we do and you should be too.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Q: How often do we get together in person?</strong><br>\nA: For people local to DC we try to get together for lunch every few weeks. For those that are remote we have a few events every year (company picnic, go-kart racing, paintball, holiday party, etc.) Some of the folks here brew beer so I suspect that they hang out more often.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Q: What benefits do you offer?</strong><br><strong>A:</strong> The salary is competitive and depends on your experience. We offer the following:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Medical, dental, and vision insurance</li>\n<li>SIMPLE IRA with company match</li>\n<li>3 weeks PTO for new employees, 4 weeks for employees with us longer than a year.</li>\n<li>8 federal holidays</li>\n<li>Choose your own laptop (hint: we like Apple products)</li>\n</ul>\n<div id=\"show_application_instructions\" class=\"button inline\">Click for Application Instructions</div>\n  <br><br><div id=\"instructions\">\n    <p>If you are interested in helping evolve information security, tell us about yourself at <a href=\"mailto:jobs@threatsim.com\">jobs@threatsim.com</a>.

That's ok. There is a very good chance you have used our software and not even known it. Telescope has been responsible for the most successful Television and live media participation shows for the last decade. American Idol, So You Think You Can Dance, NBA Slam Dunk, XFactor. These are just a few of the many major success stories we have. We create the software that handles all parts of the vote. And now we are going after social as well. We work with massive scale, big data and cutting edge technology. Our technical environment is fun and full of passionate programmers who enjoy what they do. </p>\r\n<p>We are looking for an experienced Java Lead Developer to join our backend Team. The ideal candidate will be a java pro who is looking to take the next step into management. Telescope is a small company and we are growing rapidly leaving plenty of room for our employees to grow as well. We need a strong technical lead for our backend team who feels comfortable architecting technology solutions at massive scale in clustered environments for highly visible clients. </p>        </div>\r\n            <h2>\r\n                Skills &amp; Requirements\r\n            </h2>\r\n            <div class=\"description\">\r\n<p>The Lead Developer must first and foremost have excellent experience in core Java. We don't do J2EE and only lightly use major frameworks like Spring or Hibernate. Second is a strong understanding of Mysql, not simply how to query a table. We are looking for someone with experience leading a team. We have a focus in managing large votes and use Big Data products. Experience with Hbase/Hadoop/HDFS would be a big win. We use Atlassian products for managing our development cycle, so experience with Jira, Bamboo, Confluence is a plus. </p>\r\n<p>The work environment at Telescope is fast paced and agile. We need a technical lead who is driven to get things done and has the ability to juggle tasks effectively. Oftentimes we are torn between delivering a project for a client and developing a brand new product, and a lead developer needs to be able to know where the priority lies for the team. </p>            </div>\r\n            <h2>\r\n                About Telescope\r\n            </h2>\r\n            <div class=\"description\">\r\n<p>Who are We?</p>\r\n<p>Telescope is the industry-leader for interactive consumer participation. We work with content providers, live events, digital agencies, and leading brands who want to connect with their consumers to establish more meaningful, loyal, and relevant relationships.</p>\r\n<p>What do We do?</p>\r\n<p>Telescope revolutionized audience engagement with record breaking “American Idol” audience involvement. Telescope has extended this consumer engagement expertise to develop a suite of social engagement products and second screen technologies that enable brands to extend their message across multiple devices, filter conversations that are relevant, and share content with consumers.</p>\r\n<p>Why are we Awesome?</p>\r\n<p>Just pressing “like” or a “RT” isn’t “awesome.” What is awesome is fighting for your favorite competitor on a live show with and against fellow viewers, impacting the format of a national sporting event, amplifying social consciousness, and empowering brand advocates. Telescope forges and monetizes brand loyalty through these passion driven engagements.</p>            </div>\r\n            <h3>Joel Test score: 10 out of 12</h3>\r\n            <p>\r\n                The <a href=\"http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000043.html\">Joel Test</a> is a twelve-question measure of the quality of a software team.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <ul id=\"joeltest\">\n<li class=\"checked\">Do you use source control?</li>\r\n                    <li class=\"checked\">Can you make a build in one step?</li>\r\n                    <li class=\"checked\">Do you make daily builds?</li>\r\n                    <li class=\"checked\">Do you have a bug database?</li>\r\n                    <li class=\"checked\">Do you fix bugs before writing new code?</li>\r\n                    <li>Do you have an up-to-date schedule?</li>\r\n                    <li class=\"checked\">Do you have a spec?</li>\r\n                    <li class=\"checked\">Do programmers have quiet working conditions?</li>\r\n                    <li>Do you use the best tools money can buy?</li>\r\n                    <li class=\"checked\">Do you have testers?</li>\r\n                    <li class=\"checked\">Do new candidates write code during their interview?</li>\r\n                    <li class=\"checked\">Do you do hallway usability testing?</li>\r\n            </ul>\n<div class=\"apply clear\">\r\n\r\n                            <div id=\"careers-wrapper\">\r\n                                <i data-jobid=\"40359\"></i>\r\n                                    <script type=\"text/javascript\">\r\n                                        (function () {\r\n                                            var po = document.createElement('script'); po.type = 'text/javascript'; po.async = true;\r\n                                            po.src = 'http://careers.stackoverflow.com/mvcjs/apply.js';\r\n                                            var s = document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0]; s.parentNode.insertBefore(po, s);\r\n                                        })();\r\n                                    </script>\n</div>\r\n<script id=\"embed-body\" type=\"text/template\">\r\n<i data-jobid=\"40359\"></i>\r\n\\u003cscript type=\"text/javascript\">\r\n(function () {\r\n    var po = document.createElement('script'); po.type = 'text/javascript'; po.async = true;\r\n    po.src = 'http://careers.stackoverflow.com/mvcjs/apply.js';\r\n    var s = document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0]; s.parentNode.insertBefore(po, s);\r\n})();\r\n\\u003c/script>\r\n</script>\n</div>\r\n        <img data-analyticurl=\"/analytics/jobapply/40359\" alt=\"apply\" id=\"applyanalytic\" class=\"analytic\"><span class=\"analytic\" outurl=\"/analytics/jobout/40359\"></span>", :digest => "9405c03abf03a858ea", :url => "http://careers.stackoverflow.com/jobs/40359/lead-developer-telescope" },
